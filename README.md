📸 Image to Grayscale & Threshold Converter using NumPy

This project demonstrates how to convert a color image into grayscale and then into a black-and-white (thresholded) image using NumPy.
It’s a great beginner project for understanding image processing basics without using heavy libraries like OpenCV.
